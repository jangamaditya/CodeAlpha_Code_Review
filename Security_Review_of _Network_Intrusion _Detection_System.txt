Security Review of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

Objective: Review the provided Python NIDS code for potential security vulnerabilities and recommend secure coding practices.

Identified Security Concerns & Recommendations:

  Raw Socket Usage:

	Issue: The script uses raw sockets (socket.AF_PACKET), which require root privileges. Running scripts with elevated 	privileges increases the attack surface.

	Recommendation: Use Linux capabilities (setcap) to limit privileges or libraries like scapy, which offer safer 	abstractions.

  Unvalidated JSON Parsing:

	Issue: The json.loads function directly parses log lines without validation, which can crash the script on malformed 	data.

	Recommendation: Validate the JSON structure before parsing. Use try blocks to catch parsing errors and log invalid 	entries without disrupting execution.

  Log File Growth:

	Issue: Packets are continuously logged to a CSV file without size management.

	Recommendation: You've added RotatingFileHandler — a great step! Ensure the log rotation settings match your expected 	traffic volume.

  Log File Monitoring & Rotation:

	Issue: The alert monitor tail-reads the log file but doesn’t handle file rotation (e.g., by Suricata).
	
	Recommendation: Use inotify or periodically check for file size and inode changes to handle rotation smoothly.

  In-Memory Alert Counter:

	Issue: The alert counter resets if the script is restarted.

	Recommendation: Periodically persist the counter to disk or use lightweight storage like SQLite to maintain state 	across restarts.

Suggested Improvements:

	Rate Limiting for Alerts: Prevent excessive logging of repetitive alerts.

	TLS Encryption: Encrypt logs if sent to external systems.

	Input Sanitization: Sanitize all incoming data to mitigate injection attacks.
